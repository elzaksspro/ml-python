The repository ml-python contains IPython notebooks outlining example 
implementations and 
applications of machine learning algorithms using Python 3, numpy, and maybe pandas.

These notebooks are intended to serve as examples and references for the basic gist 
of the outlined algorithms.

The motivation for creating these notebooks came from taking Andrew Ng's machine 
learning course on Coursera. The class implements the algorithms in GNU Octave / 
MATLAB so I decided to try implementing them using Python as a challenge to 
reinforce the concepts and also just for fun.
