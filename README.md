## Example python implementations of basic machine learning algorithms

The repository ml-python contains IPython notebooks outlining example implementations and 
applications of machine learning algorithms using Python 3, numpy, and maybe pandas.

## Motivation

The motivation for creating these notebooks came from taking Andrew Ng's machine
learning course on Coursera. The class implements the algorithms in GNU Octave / 
MATLAB so I decided to try implementing them using Python as a challenge, to 
reinforce the concepts, and also just for fun.

These notebooks are intended to serve as examples and references for the
basic gist of the outlined machine learning algorithms.

## Current examples:

* Linear regression
* Logistic regression
* *k*-means clustering
* Neural networks

## Upcoming examples:

These are in progress and will be uploaded soon.

* Limitations of *k*-means clustering
* Cross-validation
